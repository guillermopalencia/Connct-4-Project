### **_Getting Started_**

##### For those with little to no knowledge on the snake game, it is a very fun single player game. The premise of this game is to collect apples in a 17x17 grid while your snake increases in length for every apple. Running into yourself or the border of the grid will cause you to lose.

#### A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/qcRefxBX/project-1-connect-four).

#### The project itself was deployed and can be viewed [here](https://guillermos-connect4.surge.sh/).
